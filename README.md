### Andrew Craig

I'm a Data Scientist working in Tokyo.

Open source projects I've contributed to:
- [R extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Ikuyadeu/vscode-R)
- [R language server](https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver)
- [Jupyter Extension for Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-jupyter)

A couple of my toy projects:
- R with `(x) => x + 1` anonymous functions: https://github.com/andycraig/r-anonymous-functions/
- A compiler for a simple functional programming language, written in C and Assembly: https://github.com/andycraig/functional-compiler
- A partial implementation of a Java Virtual Machine, written in Rust: https://github.com/andycraig/jvmrust

A couple of articles I've written about programming languages:
- [Q for R programmers](https://github.com/andycraig/q-for-r-programmers/): A short article to highlight similarities between the q and R programming languages
- [APL function composition](https://github.com/andycraig/apl-function-composition): A short article to highlight a cool feature of APL which doesn't exist in most other programming languages
